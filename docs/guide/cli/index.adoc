## WildFly Glow Command Line

* Download the latest WildFly Glow CLI zip file from github link:https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-glow/releases[releases]
* Unzip the file `wildfly-glow-<version>.zip`
* cd `wildfly-glow-<version>`
* To display the CLI help call: `./wildfly-glow`
* To install the automatic CLI commands completion call: `source <(./wildfly-glow completion)`
* To scan a first deployment call: `./wildfly-glow scan ./examples/kitchensink.war`

### Maven configuration

* For Maven resolution, the CLI reads your Maven `settings.xml` in default locations.
* If your settings are in a custom location, you can use the `org.wildfly.glow.maven.settings.xml.url=<url to your settings.xml file>` system property to set it. 
* Glow enforces a set of Maven remote repositories: `central`, `jboss`, `redhat GA` and `spring`. You can disable it by using the 
`org.wildfly.glow.maven.ignore.default.repos=true` system property.
* If no local maven cache is found in the `settings.xml` file (or if no `settings.xml` file is found), 
the `<user home>/.m2/repository` directory is used. You can specify a custom location using the 
`maven.repo.local=<absolute path to the local cache directory>` system property.
